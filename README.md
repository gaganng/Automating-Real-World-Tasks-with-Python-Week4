# Coursera-Automating-Real-World-Tasks-with-Python-Week4
### This Repository contains code of "Google Automating Real-World Tasks with Python" Capstone Week 4 Project.
### This Repo has all the python scripts used in the Final Project.
### Codes are written with not so good programming practices and are kind of in-efficient.
### But they work!!!
### It is not recommended to copy this code for course Work Submission, but you can use the code for comparison and learning
## Happy Learning & Coding!!
